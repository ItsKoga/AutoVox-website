        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By using the AutoVox Bot (“the Bot”), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, you must discontinue the use of the Bot.</p>

        <h2>2. Bot Functionality</h2>
        <p>AutoVox provides automated server management, including the creation and deletion of channels and threads. Use of the Bot is subject to the permissions and limitations set by the server administrators. The Bot’s commands should be used responsibly and in accordance with server rules.</p>

        <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>- You agree not to misuse the Bot or use it in any illegal or harmful manner.</p>
        <p>- You must comply with all local laws and regulations while using the Bot.</p>
        <p>- Any form of abuse, exploitation, or manipulation of the Bot’s features will result in an immediate ban from its services.</p>

        <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>AutoVox and its developers are not liable for any damages or loss that may result from the use or misuse of the Bot. Use of the Bot is at your own risk, and it is provided on an "as-is" basis.</p>

        <h2>5. Changes to the Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to update or modify these Terms of Service at any time without prior notice. Continued use of the Bot after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.</p>

        <h2>6. Termination</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to terminate or restrict access to the Bot for any reason, including violation of these terms, without prior notice.</p>
